I started to understand JS a little bit more and I must say that I am in love with it. Somehow I've survived "Tutorial Hell" and now I am trying to learn by doing this project. 
I am thinking about some RPG game but I know that there is a lot of work to do. This is just the beginning of my front-end journey...

So far this is just a simple draft. I will try to push this further. By now my project looks like simple portfolio website without the meaningful content but it will evolve soon. I am focusing only on learning JS. I don't need anything else right now...
